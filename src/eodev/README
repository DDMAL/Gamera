Welcome to EO, the Evolving Objects library.

The latest news about EO can be found on the sourceforge repository at
    http://eodev.sourceforge.net/

In case of any problem, please e-mail us at
    eodev-main@lists.sourceforge.net

To get started, take a look at the tutorial, starting with
    ./tutorial/html/eoTutorial.html

The easiest way to start programming a new genome with all EO
evolution engines handy is to create a new standalone EO project from
the tutorial/Templates/ directory. Read Lesson 5 of the tutorial for
an introduction ;)
