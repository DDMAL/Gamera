=======================
Writing a Gamera script
=======================

Overview
--------

While the GUI is great for experimentation, the ultimate goal of any
Gamera application is usually scriptability, or the ability to run in
batch mode.  

Gamera scripts are merely Python scripts that use
Gamera objects and call Gamera functions.  The standard Python library
has lots of ways to glue Gamera inside of other applications using
Unix scripting, web services and other types of remote procedure
calls.

A script skeleton
-----------------

To use Gamera in a Python script, you simply need to import the
``gamera.core`` module and then initialize it:

.. code:: Python

   from gamera.core import *
   init_gamera()

From there, you can use Gamera's functions and methods:

.. code:: Python

   image = load_image(filename)
   onebit = image.otsu_threshold()
