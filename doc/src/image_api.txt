========================
The Gamera C++ Image API
========================

Introduction
============

This document describes how to manipulate Gamera images from C++.
This deals primarily with low-level (pixel-level) operations.

Data model
==========

Gamera uses a "shared" data model.  This means that
different "views" are applied to the same "data."  Views may only look
at a subset of the data, or they may change how the data is presented
to the programmer. The goal of decoupling the "view" from the "data" is
to allow a "view" on the data to be a very lightweight object. This
allows it to be passed by value with little worry about performance. This
also allows the processing of a portion of an image as if it were an entire
image.

For example, to create a new image, the programmer must first create
the data:

.. code:: CPP

   OneBitImageData image_data(Dim(50, 50));

This creates data that is 50 pixels width and 50 pixels high, and has
a logical origin of (0, 0).

Then you can create a view on all of the data:

.. code:: CPP

   OneBitImageView image_view(image_data);

Later, if you want to view only a subset of the data, you can use a
different overloaded version of the view constructor:

.. code:: CPP

   OneBitImageView subimage_view(image_data, Point(25, 25), Dim(10, 10));

This will create a view on the image from (25, 25) that is 10 pixels
tall and wide, i.e. the lower-right corner will be at (35, 35).  An
alternate way to do this would be to specify two points:

.. code:: CPP

   OneBitImageView subimage_view(image_data, Point(25, 25), Point(35, 35));

The different constructor forms are discussed in more detail in the
`ImageView<T> objects`_ section.


Memory management issues
------------------------

Since multiple "views" can use the same "data," one must be careful
about prematurely deallocating data objects, or there may be views left
around that "point" to deallocated data.  Accessing the data through
the view is unchecked and could result in a segmentation fault.

Another common mistake is to deallocate all views on a given data
object, forgetting to deallocate the data itself, resulting in a
memory leak.  Since there is no reference counting on the C++ side,
deallocation of all views does not automatically trigger deallocation
of the underlying data.  For example:

.. code:: CPP

   OneBitImageData image_data = new OneBitImageData(Dim(50, 50), Point(0, 0));
   OneBitImageView image_view = new OneBitImageView(*image_data);
   
   ...

   delete image_view->data(); // Don't forget to delete the data
   delete image_view;

Of course, if the new image data is the result of a plugin function,
it will be returned to the caller.  When a pointer to an image
view (``ImageView*`` or one of its subclasses) is returned to Python, it will
participate in Python memory management, and both the view and data
will eventually be deallocated automatically.  When an ``ImageView*``
is returned to another C++ function, that function is
responsible for deallocating the view and data, unless it in turn is passing
it back to Python.

Fortunately, things are much easier on the Python side, since the
number of views that point to a data object are reference counted, so
the data object is kept around only as long as there is at least one
view looking at it.

Take for example the following interactive Python session:

.. code:: Python

  Python 2.3.4 (#1, Oct 26 2004, 16:42:40)
  [GCC 3.4.2 20041017 (Red Hat 3.4.2-6.fc3)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

  segmentation, structural, thinning, threshold, tiff_support, contour
  >>> orig = load_image("test.tiff")
  >>> del orig
  # ImageData dealloc, because the only view pointing to it (orig) has been deleted.
  >>> orig = load_image("test.tiff")
  >>> orig = orig.otsu_threshold()
  # ImageData dealloc, because the pointer stored in orig has been replaced
  # with a new onebit image.  This effect is fairly subtle.
  >>> ccs = orig.cc_analysis()
  >>> del orig
  # No ImageData dealloc, since the ccs list contains views on the data.
  >>> del ccs
  # ImageData dealloc, because the remaining views on the data have been destroyed.
  >>>

Image types
-----------

You should probably familiarize yourself with different Gamera `image
types`__ before reading further.

.. __: image_types.html

``ImageData<T>`` objects
````````````````````````

Data objects are instances of the ``ImageData<T>`` class (in
``include/image_data.hpp``) where ``T`` is the pixel type.
If you wish to use run-length encoding to store the data, you can use
the ``RleImageData<T>`` class.  These classes both have the same
interface and are completely interchangeable, but will exhibit
different algorithmic complexities.

There are some typedefs in ``image_types.hpp`` to make creating
different kinds of image data objects more convenient:

.. code:: CPP

  /*
    Image Data
   */
  typedef ImageData<GreyScalePixel> GreyScaleImageData;
  typedef ImageData<Grey16Pixel> Grey16ImageData;
  typedef ImageData<FloatPixel> FloatImageData;
  typedef ImageData<RGBPixel> RGBImageData;
  typedef ImageData<OneBitPixel> OneBitImageData;
  typedef RleImageData<OneBitPixel> OneBitRleImageData;

There are a few different constructors available for data objects:

.. code:: CPP

    ImageData(const Dim& dim, const Point& offset);
    ImageData(const Dim& dim); // offset == (0, 0)
    ImageData(const Size& size, const Point& offset);
    ImageData(const Size& size); // offset == (0, 0)
    ImageData(const Rect& rect);

There are also some deprecated forms that you may see in legacy code,
but which are no longer supported since they are not consistent about
specifying *x* before *y*:

.. code:: CPP

    ImageData(size_t nrows = 1, size_t ncols = 1, size_t page_offset_y = 0,
	      size_t page_offset_x = 0);
    ImageData(const Size& size, size_t page_offset_y = 0,
	      size_t page_offset_x = 0);
    ImageData(const Dimensions& dim, size_t page_offset_y = 0,
	      size_t page_offset_x = 0);

The *offset* arguments are used to specify a logical offset of the
data.  For instance, if the image data is from part of the page, the
upper left corner may not be logically (0, 0).  This is purely for
logical purposes when your system needs to know the relative positions
of image bounding boxes, and does not affect the size of the image
data created in any way.

The ``Size`` and ``Dim`` classes are simple ways of storing
sizes and dimensions defined in ``gamera/dimensions.hpp``.  (See the
`Dimension types`__ chapter for more information). ``Size(w,
h)`` is always equal to ``Dim(w + 1, h + 1)``.  Both forms are
supported to make it easier to adapt existing algorithms that use one
or the other standard.

.. __: dimension_types.html

While there are other public members and methods to the ``ImageData``
class, we do not recommend using any of them unless you really know
what you're doing.  All of the image data can be accessed much more
flexibly and conveniently through ``ImageView`` objects.

``ImageView<T>`` objects
````````````````````````

Views objects are instances of the ``ImageView<T>`` class (in
``include/image_view.hpp``), where ``T`` is the data object type (a
templatization of ``ImageData<T>``).  There is also a special version
of ``ImageView<T>`` for connected components,
``ConnectedComponent<T>`` defined in
``include/connected_components.hpp``.  `Connected components`_ are
discussed below.

As with the data objects, there are some typedefs for convenience:

.. code:: CPP

  /*
    ImageView
   */
  typedef ImageView<GreyScaleImageData> GreyScaleImageView;
  typedef ImageView<Grey16ImageData> Grey16ImageView;
  typedef ImageView<FloatImageData> FloatImageView;
  typedef ImageView<RGBImageData> RGBImageView;
  typedef ImageView<OneBitImageData> OneBitImageView;
  typedef ImageView<OneBitRleImageData> OneBitRleImageView;

  /*
    Connected-components
   */
  typedef ConnectedComponent<OneBitImageData> Cc;
  typedef ConnectedComponent<OneBitRleImageData> RleCc;

There are a number of different ways to construct image views:

.. code:: CPP

  // Creates a view covering all of the data
  ImageView(T& image_data);

  ImageView(T& image_data, const Rect& rect, 
            bool do_range_check = true);
  ImageView(T& image_data, const Point& upper_left,
	    const Point& lower_right, bool do_range_check = true)
  ImageView(T& image_data, const Point& upper_left,
	    const Size& size, bool do_range_check = true)
  ImageView(T& image_data, const Point& upper_left,
	    const Dim& dim, bool do_range_check = true)
  
There are also some deprecated forms that you may see in legacy code,
but which are no longer supported since they are not consistent about
specifying *x* before *y*:

.. code:: CPP

  // Creates a view with a specified bounding box
  ImageView(T& image_data, size_t offset_y,
	    size_t offset_x, size_t nrows, size_t ncols,
	    bool do_range_check = true);
  ImageView(T& image_data, const Point& upper_left,
	    const Dimensions& dim, bool do_range_check = true)

The ``Size``, ``Point`` and ``Dim`` classes are simple ways of storing
sizes and dimensions defined in ``gamera/dimensions.hpp``.  (See the
`Dimension types`__ chapter for more information).

.. __: dimension_types.html

Coordinates for any given bounding boxes are relative to the offset of
the underlying data.  Therefore:

.. code:: CPP

   // Create data with an size of (64, 64) and an offset of (32, 32);
   OneBitImageData image_data(Size(64, 64), Point(32, 32));
   // This is a view over all of the data
   OneBitImageView image_view(image_data, Point(32, 32), Size(64, 64));
   // This raises an exception, since it's out of range for the data
   OneBitImageView image_view(image_data, Point(0, 0), Size(64, 64));

You can get the type of the pixels referenced by an ``ImageView``
using the expression ``typename T::value_type``.

Image factories
---------------

There are other convenience classes for creating image types.

TypeIdImageFactory
``````````````````

``TypeIdImageFactory`` is useful if you want to create an image of a
specific type based on a pair of integer constants.  For example, the
following code snippit creates a DENSE or RLE image based on an
integer constant passed in as a parameter to the function.  Note that
the types of each of the ``TypeIdImageFactory`` s are different and
not polymorphic, so the interior function (``threshold_fill``) must be
called from two locations.

.. code:: CPP

   template<class T>
   Image* threshold(const T &m, int threshold, int storage_format) {
     if (storage_format == DENSE) {
       typedef TypeIdImageFactory<ONEBIT, DENSE> fact_type;
       typename fact_type::image_type* view = fact_type::create(m.origin(), m.dim());
       threshold_fill(m, *view, threshold);
       return view;
     } else {
       typedef TypeIdImageFactory<ONEBIT, RLE> fact_type;
       typename fact_type::image_type* view = fact_type::create(m.origin(), m.dim());
       threshold_fill(m, *view, threshold);
       return view;
     }
   }

ImageFactory
````````````

It is a common use case to create a result image whose type is related
to the type of an input image.  In many cases, one could just use the
same type as the result type.  However, if a ``Cc`` image type is
passed into a function, you would most likely want to return a regular
``OneBit`` image as a result.  ``ImageFactory`` is designed to get
around this problem.  It will create an appropriate result type from
a given input type.  For example, see the following code snippet:

.. code:: CPP

   template<class T>
   Image* abutaleb_threshold(const T &m, int storage_format) {
     typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type view_type;
     view_type* average = mean(m);
   ...

Accessing pixels
================

One of the goals of the Gamera framework is to make it easy to
incorporate code from other image processing frameworks as painlessly
as possible.  Therefore, there are a number of interfaces that can be
used to access and process the underlying pixel data of an image.

.. note:: Whenever accessing individual pixels, the ``row`` and ``col``
   given are *not* relative to the offsets of the view or the
   underlying data.  In other words ``.get(0,0)`` will always return
   the pixel in the upper-left hand corner of the view.  This makes it
   easier for algorithms that work on the pixels of a view to ignore
   the complexity of the "shared" data model.

Different interfaces
--------------------

The different interfaces for accessing pixels are discussed below:

``get`` and ``set`` methods
```````````````````````````

This is perhaps the most straightforward way to access the pixels of
an image.  There are two public methods of ``ImageView``:

   - value_type **get** (const Point& *point*)

   - void **set** (const Point& *point*, value_type *value*)

There are also deprecated forms that you may see in legacy code:

   - value_type **get** (size_t *row*, size_t *col*)

   - void **set** (size_t *row*, size_t *col*, value_type *value*)

**get** returns the value of the pixel at the given row and column. 
**set** changes the pixel at the given row and column to the given
value.

An example using ``get`` / ``set`` over an entire image:

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type* test_get_set(const T& image) {
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::data_type data_type;
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type view_type;
    data_type* new_data = new data_type(image);
    view_type* new_view = new view_type(*new_data);
    
    for (size_t r = 0; r < in.nrows(); ++r) {
      for (size_t c = 0; c < in.ncols(); ++c) {
	new_view.set(Point(c, r), image.get(Point(c, r)) / 2);
      }
    }

    return new_view;
  }


C-style 2-dimensional array
```````````````````````````

An alternative is to use the notation of C-style 2-dimensional
arrays:

.. code:: CPP

   value = image[row][col];
   image[row][col] = value;

This interface is provided as a convenience to support the large body
of legacy code written in this style.  Note that ``[row][col]`` is the
reverse of get and set's ``Point(x, y)``.  Keep in mind, it is not really
a 2-diminsional array underneath -- this view is "faked."

An example using the C-style 2-dimensional array interface:

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type* test_c_2d(const T& image) {
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::data_type data_type;
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type view_type;
    data_type* new_data = new data_type(image);
    view_type* new_view = new view_type(*new_data);
    
    for (size_t r = 0; r < image.nrows(); ++r) {
      for (size_t c = 0; c < image.ncols(); ++c) {
	(*new_view)[r][c] = image[r][c] / 2;
      }
    }

    return new_view;
  }

Iterators
`````````

Iterators provide a lot of readability and convenience advantages over
the other approaches.

Gamera has three kinds of iterators:

1. Vector iterator: a one-dimensional iterator that iterates from the
   upper left hand corner, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
2. Row/column iterators: Iterates along either rows or columns.  Incrementing the iterator
   moves one row down or one column to the right.  Calling ``begin()`` on a ``row_iterator``,
   returns a ``col_iterator`` and vice versa.
3. Two-dimensional iterators: Provide free movement of the iterator in
   any direction.

The first two kinds of iterators follow the conventions of the C++ STL
enough that they can be used with STL algorithms.  All iterators are
available in ``const`` and non-``const`` versions.  ``const``
iterators can not change the underlying data.  If you have an image
passed into your function as a ``const ImageView<T> &``, you will not
be able to change the pixels in the image, and thus will only be able
to get ``const`` iterators from it.

Note that you can call ``row( )`` or ``col( )`` on any
iterator to obtain the current row and column position of the iterator.

All Gamera iterators can get/set their values in two ways, both of
which boiling down to exactly the same machine code, and therefore
having the same efficiency:

1. The standard "C pointer-like" way:

.. code:: CPP

   // i is any iterator type
   value = *i;
   *i = value;

2. Using ``get`` and ``set`` methods:
   
.. code:: CPP

   // i is any iterator type
   value = i.get();
   i.set(value);

Vector iterator
'''''''''''''''

Vector iterators (``ImageView<T>::vec_iterator``) can be convenient when the operation works one pixel
at a time and does not need to be aware of any spatial relationships.

An example using ``vec_iterators``:

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type* test_vec_iterator(const T& image) {
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::data_type data_type;
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type view_type;
    data_type* new_data = new data_type(image);
    view_type* new_view = new view_type(*new_data);

    typename T::const_vec_iterator i = image.vec_begin();
    typename view_type::vec_iterator j = new_view->vec_begin();

    for ( ; i != image.vec_end(); ++i, ++j) {
      *j = *i / 2;  // or  j.set(i.get() / 2);
    }

    return new_view;
  }

Since the Gamera image iterators follow the STL iterator interface,
they can be used with builtin STL algorithms.  For instance, to fill
an entire image with white using the STL ``std::fill`` algorithm:

.. code:: CPP

  #include <algorithm> 

  template<class T>
  void fill_white(T& image) {
    std::fill(image.vec_begin(), image.vec_end(), white(image));
  }

Row/column iterators
''''''''''''''''''''

Sometimes it is necessary to have nested loops, one for rows and one
for columns.

The following is an example using row iterators (``ImageView<T>::row_iterators``) and
column interators (``ImageView<T>::col_iterators``):

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type* test_row_col_iterator(const T& image) {
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::data_type data_type;
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type view_type;
    data_type* new_data = new data_type(image);
    view_type* new_view = new view_type(*new_data);

    typedef typename T::const_row_iterator IteratorI;
    IteratorI ir = image.row_begin();
    typedef typename view_type::row_iterator IteratorJ;
    IteratorJ jr = new_view->row_begin();
    for ( ; ir != image.row_end(); ++ir, ++jr) {
      typename IteratorI::iterator ic = ir.begin();
      typename IteratorJ::iterator jc = jr.begin();
      for ( ; ic != ir.end(); ++ic, ++jc)
	*jc = *ic / 2;
    }

    return new_view;
  }

The fun thing about row and column iterators is that they are
interchangable.  If you wish to iterate through the image in column
major order instead, you could write:

.. code:: CPP

  template<class T>
  typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type* test_col_row_iterator(const T& image) {
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::data_type data_type;
    typedef typename ImageFactory<T>::view_type view_type;
    data_type* new_data = new data_type(image);
    view_type* new_view = new view_type(*new_data);

    typedef typename T::const_col_iterator IteratorI;
    IteratorI ir = image.col_begin();
    typedef typename view_type::col_iterator IteratorJ;
    IteratorJ jr = new_view->col_begin();
    for ( ; ir != image.col_end(); ++ir, ++jr) {
      typename IteratorI::iterator ic = ir.begin();
      typename IteratorJ::iterator jc = jr.begin();
      for ( ; ic != ir.end(); ++ic, ++jc)
	*jc = *ic / 2;
    }

    return new_view;
  }

Of course, that really should be templatized on the iterator type.
For an example of this, see ``include/plugins/projections.hpp``.

Row and column iterators also have methods that return the current row
and column (relative to the underlying data).  ``i.row()`` returns the
current row and ``i.col()`` returns the current column.

Two-dimensional iterators
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Unlike the other kinds of iterators, two-dimensional iterators are a
long way from C++ STL convention.  The idea of these iterators was
borrowed from the VIGRA_ library.  More documentation is available
there, but I've provided a short summary below.

.. _VIGRA: http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/vigra/

You can obtain a two-dimensional iterator from an image using of
the following methods:

.. code:: CPP

    Iterator upperLeft();
    Iterator lowerRight();

Once you have a two-dimensional iterator, you can move it using the
following:

.. code:: CPP

   typename T::Iterator i;
   
   ++i.x; // move right
   --i.x; // move left
   ++i.y; // move down
   --i.y; // move up

You can see that this gives more freedom and expressivity than the
other iterators.

When you assign one two-dimensional iterator to another, it is copied,
so there are no persistent connections between them.

.. code:: CPP
   
   typename T::Iterator center, below;
   
   ...

   below = center;
   ++below.y;	// 'below' points to the pixel below 'center'
   ++center.x;  // 'center' moved.  'below' did not.

You can also perform arithmetic on these iterators on the fly:

.. code:: CPP

   typename T::Iterator center, below;
   
   ...

   below = center.y + 1; // 'center' is not moved

If you need to move in two dimensions at once, you can either add or subtract
a ``Diff2D`` object from the iterator, or use the ``operator()``
method.

.. code:: CPP

   typename T::Iterator i, relative;
   
   ...

   relative = i + Diff2D(1, 1)   // down and to the right
   relative = i[Diff2D(1, 1)]    // equivalent to above
   relative = i + Diff2D(-1, -1) // up and to the left

   relative = i - Diff2D(1, 1)   // up and to the left
   relative = i - Diff2D(-1, -1) // down and to the right

   relative = i(1, 1)            // down and to the right
   relative = i(-1, -1)	         // up and to the left

For an example of how two-dimensional iterators can be used in a more
real-world situation, see the ``cc_analysis`` method in
``include/plugins/segmentation.py``.

Speed tests
```````````

The different interfaces are provided primarily to support different
programming styles.  However, they do not run at the same speed.

The following graph shows the relative speeds of different pixel
access methods (using the examples above).  These results are largely
processor and architecture dependent, so take them with a truckload of
salt.

.. image:: images/pixel_access_runtimes.png

The performance of the 1-dimensional iterator is perhaps surprising,
since it appears to be the simplest code.  In fact, however,
``vec_iterators`` must support the image view model, and therefore do
basic "range checking" upon each increment.  This introduces some
overhead.

.. _VIGRA: http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/vigra/

The row/column iterators in row major order (rows in the outer loop) is
the clear winner.  Since the underlying data is stored row major order,
accessing it in column major order is a major performance hit, in part
due to the extra pointer arithmetic and in part due to worse cache performance.

.. note:: Any performance improvement should be justified only by
   profiling on real-world data

Making generic programming work
===============================

Everything discussed so far has been completely polymorphic: these techniques
should work identically on all types of images.  However, where the
images vary is in the pixel types themselves.  Careful programming
can keep your algorithms generic across all pixel types, but when
that is no longer possible, it is also possible to specialize
(i.e. write a special version of an algorithm for a particular pixel
type.)

First, let's cover some more details of the various pixel types
available in Gamera.  They are all defined in ``include/pixel.hpp``.

``RGB``
	RGB pixels are represented by instances of the ``Rgb`` class.
	By default, each plane is represented by an 8-bit ``unsigned char``
	The individual RGB planes can be get/set using the ``red``,
	``green`` and ``blue`` functions.  The values follow the
	standard hardware conventions: larger values are higher
	intensity.
        There are also many utility methods
	for converting the RGB pixel into other kinds of
	values.  See ``include/pixel.hpp`` for more information.
	``Rgb`` instances are small enough (3 bytes) that you can safely pass
	them by value without performance concerns.

``GREYSCALE``
	GreyScale pixels are 8-bit ``unsigned char`` values in the range 0
	- 255.  These also
	follow the hardware convention that larger values are higher
	intensity (white).

``FLOAT``
	Float pixels are 32-bit floating-point ``float`` values.  They
	follows the hardware convention that larger values are higher
	intensity (white).  Unlike the integral pixel types, there is
	no set range for the values (they can even be negative).  For
	this reason, the Gamera display will always find the lowest
	and highest values and then normalize the display to match the
	dynamic range of the display hardware.  Floating point images
	are most useful to represent non-image data, such as the
	results of the convolution of two images.

``ONEBIT``
	OneBit pixels are 16-bit ``unsigned char`` values.  Perhaps
	confusingly, a value of 0 is white (which is usually
	``background`` in most document images) and *all other values*
	are black.  The extra bits of range are used when a connected
	component analysis is performed.  Each connected component in
	an image is assigned a ``label`` value, and its pixels are
	labeled using the value.  Since the directionality of OneBit
	pixels is different from all other pixel types, care must be
	taken when writing algorithms that accept OneBit images and
	other images.

Black and white
---------------

Convenience functions are provided to get and test values for white
and black pixels that work on all pixel types.

.. code:: CPP

  T pixel_traits<T>::white();
  T pixel_traits<T>::black();

Return the values for white and black, respectively, for the given
pixel type ``T``.  Often, it is more convenient to get the pixel value
from the ``ImageView`` type, and not the pixel type.  Therefore, the
functions

.. code:: CPP

  T::value_type white(T& image_type);
  T::value_type black(T& image_type);

are also provided.

You can also test whether a pixel is white or black using:

.. code:: CPP

  bool is_white(T pixel_value);
  bool is_black(T pixel_value);

Writing a specialized function
------------------------------

As specified in `Writing Gamera Plugins`__, each plugin function
should be templatized to accept multiple image types.  Sometimes,
though, a single code base will not work for all images types, or
there are performance gains to be had by writing for a particular
image type.

.. __: writing_plugins.html

The wrinkle that makes this less than straightforward is that you
often want to specialize on the **pixel type**, not the **image
type**.  For instance, there are multiple **image types** where the
**pixel type** is ``ONEBIT`` (OneBitImageView, Cc, OneBitRleImageView
etc.).  Therefore, you will normally want to have a helper function
which is templatized on the pixel type, which is called from the main
function.  See for example, the ``invert`` plugin method, which needs
to do something different for FLOAT images (since the range of FLOAT
pixels is not fixed.):

.. code:: CPP

  /* Invert an image */

  // This is the generic version
  template<class Pixel>
  struct invert_specialized {
    template<class T>
    void operator()(T& image) {
      ImageAccessor<typename T::value_type> acc;
      typename T::vec_iterator in = image.vec_begin();
      for (; in != image.vec_end(); ++in)
	acc.set(invert(acc(in)), in);
    }
  };

  // This is specialied for FLOAT pixels
  template<>
  struct invert_specialized<FloatPixel> {
    template<class T>
    void operator()(T& image) {
      FloatPixel max = 0;
      max = find_max(image.parent());
      ImageAccessor<FloatPixel> acc;
      typename T::vec_iterator in = image.vec_begin();
      for (; in != image.vec_end(); ++in)
	acc.set(max - acc(in), in);
    }
  };

  // This is the top level function that calls the correct
  // specialization
  template<class T>
  void invert(T& image) {
    invert_specialized<typename T::value_type> invert_special;
    invert_special(image);
  }


Connected components
====================

Connected components (``CC``) are a special kind of view on ``ONEBIT`` image
data. The implementation (ab)uses the fact that ``ONEBIT`` images are 
actually stored as 16-bits-per-pixel data. Therefore all pixels belonging to
the same CC are set to the same pixel value (the "connected component label")
and pixels belonging to different CCs have different pixel values.

Each CC object defines a bounding box and a ``label`` value which
indicates the pixel value that the CC object corresponds to.
Pixels with that value will appear to be black, and pixels without
that value will appear to be white.

As a programmer using a CC object, this detail should not matter
most of the time: it will behave as a standalone ``ONEBIT`` image.
However, care should be taken when setting the values of a CC
object: it may be possible to make pixels "disappear" by setting them
to a value other than ``label``.


Using CCs from Python
---------------------

CCs behave like image views with the additional property ``label``.
You can remove a particular CC with ``fill_white``:

.. code:: Python

  # remove all CCs with an aspect ration > 3
  ccs = onebit.cc_analysis()
  for c in ccs:
    if float(c.nrows) / c.ncols > 3.0:
       c.fill_white()

You can even take a CC from one image and highlight its black pixels
on a different image:

.. code:: Python

  # mark all CCs with an aspect ration > 3 in red
  # wihtout changing the original image
  ccs = onebit.cc_analysis()
  rgb = onebit.to_rgb()
  for c in ccs:
    if float(c.nrows) / c.ncols > 3.0:
       rgb.highlight(c, RGBPixel(255,0,0))


Using CCs from C++
------------------

On the C++ side, you can access CCs just like in Python:

.. code:: CPP

  ImageList* ccs = cc_analysis(image);
  ImageList::iterator ccs_it;
  size_t x,y;

  // loop over all ccs
  for (ccs_it = ccs->begin(); ccs_it != ccs->end(); ++ccs_it) {

    // query cc label
    int label = cc->label();

    // Loop over individual pixels
    for (y=0; y < cc->nrows(); y++)
      for (x=0; x < cc->ncols(); x++)
        if is_black(cc->get(Point(x,y))) { // .... }
  }

For creating a list of CCs from C++, two steps are necessary:

 1) Setting all pixels in the image to its label value

 2) Call the constructor for each CC:

    .. code:: CPP

      // Assumptions:
      //   the CC labels have been stored in the vector "labelvec"
      //   the CC dimensions have been stored in the vector "rectvec"
      ccs = new ImageList();
      for (size_t i = 0; i < labelvec.size(); ++i) {
        ccs->push_back(new ConnectedComponent<typename T::data_type>(
                         *((typename T::data_type*)image.data()),
                         labelvec[i],
                         Point(rectvec[i]->offset_x() + image.offset_x(),
                               rectvec[i]->offset_y() + image.offset_y()),
                         rectvec[i]->dim()
                        ));
      }
