==================
matplotlib support
==================

Gamera includes optional support for plotting figures using the
matplotlib_ library.  If matplotlib is not installed on your machine,
Gamera will continue to work normally, but plotting support will not
be available.

.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

The matplotlib library provides high-quality plots, including line,
scatter, bar, and polar plots, and export of those plots to formats
such as PostScript, SVG, PNG or the printer.  The list of features is
way too long to go into here.  This document only describes the bridge
between the Gamera GUI and matplotlib.  For more information, see the
matplotlib_ documentation.

The connection between Gamera and matplotlib is intentionally minimal,
so that it is easy to take advantage of all of matplotlib's
functionality and to make it less dependant on any one specific
version of matplotlib.  If you feel that particular graphs of
particular kinds of data in Gamera should be made more convenient,
please contact that Gamera authors.

Obtaining matplotlib
--------------------

Download and install matplotlib_ following the instructions provided.

There are no special steps to make matplotlib work with Gamera.  If it
is installed in the default location, Gamera will automatically detect
and use it.

Interactive use
---------------

Sequences of numbers will appear in the Gamera icon display as one of
the following icons:

  +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  | |IntVector|                            | A sequence of ints.                    |
  +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  | |FloatVector|                          | A sequence of floats.                  |
  +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
  | |ComplexVector|                        | A sequence of complex numbers.         |
  +----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

.. |IntVector| image:: images/int_vector.png
.. |FloatVector| image:: images/float_vector.png
.. |ComplexVector| image:: images/complex_vector.png

For example, loading an image into the variable ``image0`` and typing the following
into the Gamera console, will produce a [Z] icon in the icon display:

.. code:: Python
    
   >>> projection_cols0 = image0.projection_cols()

Double-clicking a vector icon will plot it using
matplotlib in a new plot window.  You will be prompted to provide a
variable for the figure.  (This figure instance can be used to modify
the plot).

  .. image:: images/matplotlib_example1.png

Dragging a vector icon into an existing plot will add it to the
plot using a line of a different color.

  .. image:: images/matplotlib_example2.png

The toolbar buttons in the matplotlib window can be used to
modify and then save or print the view.  The behavior is the same as
for the standard matplotlib viewing windows.

Properties of the figure can be accessed through the figure object
returned.  For instance, to add a title:

.. code:: Python

   >>> figure0.axes[0].set_title("Projections")

Using matplotlib directly
-------------------------

To move beyond simple line plots, matplotlib can be used directly as
described in the matplotlib docs, using the object-oriented or
``pylab`` interfaces.

The following example uses the ``pylab`` interface and is taken
directly from the matplotlib example ``plot_demo.py``.  This code can
either be entered directly into the Gamera console, or imported from a
file.

.. code:: Python

  from pylab import *

  # radar green, solid grid lines
  rc('grid', color='#316931', linewidth=1, linestyle='-')
  rc('tick', labelsize=15)
  # force square figure and square axes looks better for polar, IMO
  figure(figsize=(8,8))
  ax = axes([0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8], polar=True, axisbg='#d5de9c')

  r = arange(0,1,0.001)
  theta = 2*2*pi*r
  polar(theta, r, color='#ee8d18', lw=3)

  title("And there was much rejoicing!", fontsize=20)
  savefig('polar_demo')
  show()
