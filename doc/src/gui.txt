==============
The Gamera GUI
==============

Starting the GUI
----------------

There is a ``gamera_gui`` script installed somewhere on your system
(platform-specific, see `Building and Installing Gamera`__).  Run it
to start the Gamera GUI. 

.. __: install.html

.. note:: It is possible to run Gamera image processing without the
   GUI, saving the memory and runtime overhead.

Console window
--------------

  .. image:: images/console.png

The main Gamera console window is divided into three parts: the Python
console, the icon display and the history.

Python console
``````````````

On the right is a standard Python console.  You can type code
here and it is run interactively.  Most operations that you perform
using the mouse in the GUI will generate code that is entered in the
interpreter here.  This code and be copied-and-pasted into your
favorite programmer's editor to build Gamera image processing scripts.

The Python console features auto-completion.  For example, load an
image and store it in the variable name ``image``.  Type ``image.`` in
the console, and a window will appear showing all of the (many)
members and methods of the image.

  .. image:: images/autocompletion.png

Icon display
````````````

On the left, all active image objects (displayed as icons.  When you load images,
they are displayed here.

The icon indicates the pixel type of the image.  See `Image types`__
for more information on the different image types in Gamera.  

A magnifying glass appears over the icon if the image is a subimage of
another image.  It acts as a warning that any changes made to this
image will affect another.

.. __: image_types.html

The icons are as follows:

  +------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
  | Image            | SubImage            | Description           |  
  +==================+=====================+=======================+
  | |RGBImage|       | |RGBSubImage|       | RGB (24-bit color)    |
  +------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
  | |GREYSCALEImage| | |GREYSCALESubImage| | GreyScale (8-bit)     |  
  +------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
  | |GREY16Image|    | |GREY16SubImage|    | Grey16 (16-bit)       |
  +------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
  | |FLOATImage|     | |FLOATSubImage|     | Floating-point image  |
  +------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
  | |ONEBITImage|    | |ONEBITSubImage|    | One-bit (binary)      |
  +------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+

.. |RGBImage| image:: images/icon_image_rgb.png
.. |GREYSCALEImage| image:: images/icon_image_grey.png
.. |GREY16Image| image:: images/icon_image_grey16.png
.. |FLOATImage| image:: images/icon_image_float.png
.. |ONEBITImage| image:: images/icon_image_binary.png

.. |GREY16SubImage| image:: images/icon_subimage_grey16.png
.. |FLOATSubImage| image:: images/icon_subimage_float.png
.. |ONEBITSubImage| image:: images/icon_subimage_binary.png

There are other things that can appear in the icon display as well:

  +------------------+------------------------------------------+
  | |ImageList|      | A list of images                         |
  +------------------+------------------------------------------+
  | |Cc|             | A connected component                    |
  +------------------+------------------------------------------+
  | |Classifier|     | A classifier object                      |
  +------------------+------------------------------------------+
  | |NonClassifier|  | A non-interactive classifier object      |
  +------------------+------------------------------------------+

.. |ImageList| image:: images/icon_image_list.png
.. |Cc| image:: images/icon_cc.png
.. |Classifier| image:: images/icon_classify.png
.. |NonClassifier| image:: images/icon_noninter_classify.png

Context menu
''''''''''''

Right-clicking on any of these icons brings up a context menu to
perform operations on an image.

  .. image:: images/right_click_menu.png

At the top of the menu, the pixel type is displayeimage_api.htmld.

The next two items are for creating new references and copies of the
image.  You will be prompted for a variable name for the result.

The **Info** submenu displays basic information about the image.

The rest of the context menu contains plugin methods, sorted by category.  The
plugin methods are documented here__.
Many of the plugin methods require arguments.  In that case, a dialog
will be displayed.  For example the dialog for ``erode_dilate`` is:

  .. image:: images/erode_dilate_dialog.png

After entering the arguments for a plugin function, code is generated
to perform the operation and automatically run in the console:

.. code:: Python

   >>>image.erode_dilate(5, 0, 1)

.. __: plugins.html

History
```````

At the bottom of the console window is a history which displays all of
the code that has been entered in the Python console.  Code can be
copied and pasted from here to build Gamera scripts.

Image display
-------------

Double-clicking on the image icon will display the image in its own
window.  Alternatively, you can use the ``display`` method:

.. code:: Python

   >>>image.display()

.. image:: images/display.png

Rectangular regions of the image can be selected by clicking and
dragging a bounding box on the image itself.  The selection can be modified by dragging the
drag boxes in the corners of the selection.

Right-clicking on the image brings up the same `context menu`_ as in the `icon display`_.

The image display toolbar has the following buttons:

  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |Refresh|       | Force a refresh of the display, in case any change has       |
  |                 | occurred to the image.                                       |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomIn|        | Zoom in.                                                     |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomNorm|      | Actual size.                                                 |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomIn|        | Zoom out.                                                    |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomHighlight| | Zoom so that the highlighted region is fit to the window     |
  |                 | as closely as possible.                                      |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Zoom quality    | low quality						   |

.. |NewCopy| image:: images/icon_image_copy.png

Multiple image display
----------------------

Double-clicking on a list of images in the icon display brings up the
**multi-image display** window.  Alternatively, you can use the
``display_multi`` function:

.. code:: Python

  >>>display_multi(list_of_images)

Images are displayed in a grid.  By default, the images are sorted so
the grid takes up a minimum amount of total space.

  .. image:: images/multi_display.png

Images can be selected by clicking on a cell in the grid.  Individual cells
can be added to the selection by **Ctrl** clicking.  Ranges of cells
can be selected by **Shift** clicking.

The `context menu`_ can be used to perform operations on multiple
images.  Right-clicking on a selected image brings up the context menu.

The multi-display toolbar has the following items:

  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |Refresh|       | Force a refresh of the display, in case any change has       |
  |                 | occurred to the image.                                       |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomIn|        | Zoom in.                                                     |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomNorm|      | Actual size.                                                 |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |ZoomIn|        | Zoom out.                                                    |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |Label|         | Displays a value within each cell. The value is determined by|
  |                 | the expression in the drop-down text box to the left of      |
  |                 | the label button.                                            |
  |                 | Within the context of the expression, `x` represents the     |
  |                 | image within each cell, and the expression is evaluated to   |
  |                 | determine the result to display.                             |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |SortA| |SortD| | Sorts the images in the grid based on a given property.  The |
  |                 | property is determined by the expression in the drop-down    |
  |                 | text box to the left of the sort buttons.                    |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |Select|        | Selects the image in the grid based on a given criteria.     |
  |                 | The criteria is determined by the expression in the drop-down|
  |                 | text box to the left of the select button.                   |  
  |                 | Within the context of the expression, `x` represents the     |
  |                 | image within each cell.  When the expression evaluates to    |
  |                 | ``True``, the image will be selected.                        |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |SelectAll|     | Selects all images.                                          |

Interactive classifier window
-----------------------------

The interactive classifier window is the most involved part of the
Gamera GUI.  It is where you can train the Gamera classifier to
recognize different symbol types.

  .. image:: images/classifier_window.png

Concepts
````````

Before the parts of the classifier window are discussed, some general
concepts should be understood.

Databases
'''''''''

In the classifier window, there are two sets of connected components
(glyphs) involved: the current database and the production database:

Current database
  The set of glyphs on the currently displayed image.

Production database
  Works "behind-the-scenes" by the classifier to classify future
  connected components.  The production database can contain glyphs
  from a number of images, or it may be a pre-pruned set of training
  data.

When glyphs in the current database are classified by the user, they
are copied into the production database

Coloring
''''''''

When connected components are displayed in the classifier, they are
colored according to how they were classified:

  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | Color    | Constant     | Description                                         |
  +==========+==============+=====================================================+
  | |UColor| | UNCLASSIFIED | The connected component is completely unclassified. |
  | (white)  |              |                                                     |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |AColor| | AUTOMATIC    | The connected component was classified by the       | 
  | (red)    |              | automatic classifier using training data.           |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |HColor| | HEURISTIC    | The connected component was classified by some      |
  | (yellow) |              | heuristic (non-exemplar-based) process.             |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |MColor| | MANUAL       | The connected component was classified by a human.  |
  | (green)  |              |                                                     |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

.. |UColor| image:: images/unclassified_color.png
.. |AColor| image:: images/autoclassified_color.png
.. |HColor| image:: images/heuristicclassified_color.png
.. |MColor| image:: images/manualclassified_color.png

Class names
'''''''''''

"Class names" name a particular class of symbol.  Class names are made
up of period-delimited parts so that they can be grouped into
categories.  Names can be invented on the fly.

For instance, if you were training for a subset of the characters in the
English language, you might have the following class names::

  lower.a
  lower.b
  lower.c

  upper.a
  upper.b
  upper.c

  punctuation.comma

These period-delimited parts are used to create a tree-like structure
in the classifier window that might look something like:

  .. image:: images/symbol_table_example.png

Special class names
...................

Special class names begin with an underscore (``_``).

``_group``
  Glyphs trained with names beginning with ``_group.`` are first
  grouped together and then trained as a single unit.  For instance,
  you may wish to train lowercase i's (which are made up of two
  connected components) as a single logical unit.  Select both parts
  (by dragging a bounding box around them in the original image
  display) and then train as ``_group.lower.i``.

``_split``
  Glyphs trained with names beginning with ``_split.`` are run
  through a given splitting algorithm.  For instance, glyphs that
  need to be broken into upper and lower halves for further
  classification of those parts would be trained as
  ``_split.splity``.  When the automatic classifier encounters glyphs
  that most closely match those trained as ``_split``, it will perform
  the splitting algorithm and then continue to recursively classify its parts.

  The splitting algorithms are documented `here`__.

.. __: plugins.html#segmentation

  New splitting algorithms can be created by `writing plugin`__ methods
  in the category ``Segmentation``.  

.. __: writing_plugins.html

Parts of the classifier window
``````````````````````````````

The interactive classifier window is divided into three parts: The
symbol table, the connected component display, and the original image
display.

Symbol table
''''''''''''

The symbol table is a heirarchical tree of symbol names that are
currently in use.  It is preloaded with `special class names`_.

Symbols can be trained by typing the class name in the text box at
the top or double-clicking on a class name in the tree.  The text box
features auto-completion (similar to the Unix shell), so you can type
a partial name and then press the <Tab> key to attempt to complete it.

Connected component display
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The connected component display behaves identically to the `multiple
image display`_.

When connected components are selected, they are highlighted in the
original image display below.

Connected components are colored based on their classification state.
(See `coloring`_).

There are some additional toolbar buttons:

  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |Delete|        | Deletes the selected connected components.  They will be     |
  |                 | displayed with a red-hatching pattern to indicate they are   |
  |                 | deleted.  Re-sorting the connected component display will    |
  |                 | remove them completely.  Deleted glyphs are never saved to   |
  |                 | disk.                                                        |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |NextU| |NextA| | Auto-move toggles.					   |
  |                 | Whenever a glyph is classified, the 'cursor' will            |
  | |NextH| |NextM| | automatically move to the next glyph that matches any of the |
  |                 | selected types: UNCLASSIFIED, AUTOMATIC, HEURISTIC or MANUAL.|
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

.. |Delete| image:: images/icon_delete.png
.. |NextU| image:: images/icon_next_unclass.png
.. |NextA| image:: images/icon_next_autoclass.png
.. |NextH| image:: images/icon_next_heurclass.png
.. |NextM| image:: images/icon_next_manclass.png


Original image display
''''''''''''''''''''''

The original image display, for the most part, behaves identically to
the standard `image display`_.

Clicking on a connected component will select it in the connected
component display.  Dragging a bounding box around a
collection of connected components will select multiple connected
components.  Additional connected components can be added to the
selection by Shift-clicking.

There are some additional toolbar buttons:

  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | |Mark|          | (Toggle) Display an animated rectangle around the            |
  |                 | currently selected connected component.                      |
  +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Classifier menu
```````````````

File menu
'''''''''

**Open all...**
  Opens a special directory of files containing an original image, and
  the production and current databases.  This directory should be one
  created by **Save all...**

**Save all...**
  Saves all of the data necessary to restore the classifier's state
  into a special directory.  This includes the original image and the
  production and current databases.  This special directory can be
  reloaded using **Open all...**.

The following options are used to save and load connected components in the
`Gamera XML format`__.

.. __: xml_format.html

**Save by criteria...**
  For *expert* users.  Provides a complex dialog box to save different
  sets of glyphs to a single XML file.

  .. image:: images/save_by_criteria.png

**Production database**
  The production database is the set of glyphs that affect the
  currently active classifier.  This menu allows one to Open, Merge,
  Save, Save As or Clear the production database.

**Current database**
  The current database is the set of glyphs visible in the connected
  components display.  This menu allows one to Open, Merge, Save, Save
  As the current database.  The selected
  connected components only can also be saved.

**Symbol names**
  Import or export a set of symbol names.  Symbol names can be
  imported from a full Gamera XML file containing images, or a symbol
  name-only Gamera XML file.

Image menu
''''''''''

**Open and segment image...**
  Loads an image from disk and then performs a given segmentation
  algorithm on it to create connected components.  The segmentation
  algorithm can be selected from the drop-down list.  (If you're not
  sure which one to use, try ``cc_analysis``.)  The connected
  components are loaded into the connected component display and the
  original image is loaded into the original image display.

**Select and segment image...**
  Select an already-loaded image from the console, and perform a given
  segmentation algorithm on it to create connected components.  The
  segmentation algorithm can be selected from the drop-down list.  (If
  you're not sure which one to use, try ``cc_analysis``.)  The
  connected components are loaded into the connected component display
  and the original image is loaded into the original image display.

**Select image...**
  Select an already-loaded image from the console and use it as the
  original image.  This image does not have to correspond to the
  current database.

**Save glyphs separately...**
  Saves each of the connected components into a separate image file in
  a given directory using one of the following sets of connected
  components:

    - Production database
    - Current database
    - Selected glyphs


Classifier menu
'''''''''''''''

**Guess all** / **Guess selected**
  Classifies the glyphs using the automatic classifier.  Glyphs that
  were classified manually are not reclassified (they must be
  unclassified first).

  
**Group and guess all** / **Group and guess selected**
  Classifies the glyphs using the automatic classifier, while
  attempting to group nearby connected components to form glyphs that
  are more similar to glyphs in the production database.  This process
  can take considerably longer than one-by-one classification.

**Confirm all** / **Confirm selected**
  Treats all automatically classified glyphs as if they were manually
  classified and adds them to the production database.  Use this
  function when you are sure all glyphs are correctly classified.

**Change set of features**
  Change which features of the connected components are used for
  classification.  The features themselves are documented here__.

.. __: plugins.html#features

  .. image:: images/feature_selection.png

**Classifier settings**
  Allows the settings specific to a particular classifier type to be
  changed, saved or loaded.

**Create noninteractive copy**
  When training is completed (or partially completed) this function
  will create a noninteractive copy, which is likely more optimized
  than the interactive version (depending on the classifier type).

Classifier optimization (Biollante)
-----------------------------------

  "Biollante is the result of an experiment in genetic
  engineering. The creature was created by splicing together the DNA
  of three organisms: a rose, a human female (Erica, daughter of the
  scientist), and Godzilla himself."

For our purposes, Biollante is a small GUI for optimizing kNN
classifiers using a genetic algorithm.  The genetic algorithm is used
to adjust the weights of the feature dimensions.

Overview
````````

To use Biollante, from the Gamera console window, select **File ->
Biolante**.  From the Biollante window, select **File -> Open** to
open a `Gamera XML file`__ containing some training data.  You will be
prompted to select a set of features to use for classification.  Once
some training data has been loaded you may use the **Optimizer** menu to
start and stop the classifier. After running the optimizer for some
time, the best weights can be saved using **File -> Save**.

.. __: gamera_xml.html

Status page
```````````

  .. image:: images/biollante_status.png

The Biollante status page displays information about the current state
of the optimization and allows some parameters to be set.  Parameters
may not be changed while the optimizer is running.  These parameters
may or may not affect the ability of the classifier to find a
near-optimal solution.  For more information, see a genetic algorithms
text such as [Holland1975]_.

All recognition rates are expressed in percentages.

**Initial recognition rate**
   The initial leave-one-out performance of the classifier using flat
   weights.

**Best rate**
   The best leave-one-out performance seen so far.  This corresponds
   to the performance of the set of weights that are saved.

**Current generation**
   The number of generations (of the genetic algorithm) that have run
   so far.

**Elapsed time**

**Population size**
   The number of alleles (sets of weights) to be used in each
   generation.

**Size of k**
   The number of nearest neighbors used to obtain a result from the
   *k* nearest neighbor algorithm.
