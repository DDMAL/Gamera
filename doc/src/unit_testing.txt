Unit testing with Gamera
========================

Introduction
============

Gamera does not contain its own unit testing framework, but instead
uses the great `py.test`__ framework.  

.. note::

  **py.test** is still considered beta-level software, and is somewhat
  cumbersome to install (perhaps the same could be said about
  Gamera).  It is not required for proper operation of Gamera, and is
  only needed for those developers who wish to port Gamera to new
  platforms or write unit tests for new code.

This document does not attempt to replicate the `py.test`__
documentation, and will only discuss Gamera-specific additions.

Mile-high view
==============

1. Install and test `py.test` using the instructions here__.

.. __: http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/

2. From the gamera/tests directory, run all the unit tests with the
   command::

     py.test

3. New unit tests can be added following the instructions in the
   py.test documentation.

Testing Gamera plugins
======================

The unit test in ``gamera/tests/test_plugins.py`` will load and run
the ``doc_example`` functions of all plugins available in Gamera.
Therefore, writing a unit test for a Gamera plugin is often as simple
as writing a ``doc_example`` plugin with the function.  This is
explained in `Writing Plugins: Documenting and unit-testing Plugin
functions`__.
