Building and installing Gamera
==============================

Microsoft Windows
=================

Installing from source
----------------------

Currently, Gamera can be built using the MingW32/GNU toolset.
The "officially supported" configuration, (i.e. the one that the
Gamera developers use) is to use the MingW32 compiler
to build for the official Python.org Python. This can be done in
one of the following two ways:

- with the `standalone Mingw32`__ toolchain (easiest solution)

.. __: #mingw32

- or with the MingW32 compiler installed `inside of Cygwin`__

.. __: #cygwin

If you have success with other compilers and configurations,
please consider contributing your experiences to this documentation.

Prerequisites
`````````````

- Python 2.4.x or later (only the distribution from python.org has been tested)

- wxPython 2.6.x or later (wxPython 2.8.x or later recommended for
  full functionality)

.. _mingw32:

Standalone Mingw32
``````````````````

Install the Mingw32 port of gcc from http://mingw.org/. Make sure
that you do not only install *gcc-core*, but also *g++* and *make*.
Add the *bin* subdirectory of your Mingw32 installation to
the environment variable ``PATH``.

Assuming you have installed Python to ``C:\Python25``, you can
then compile gamera at a DOS command prompt from the root directory
of the gamera source code with::

  C:\Python25\python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst

This will create a Windows installer, including uninstallation support,
in the *dist* subdirectory. It can be started with a double click
in the Explorer, or from the DOS command prompt with::

  start dist\gamera-X.X.X-win32.exe


.. _cygwin:

Mingw32 inside Cygwin
`````````````````````

Use the installer from http://www.cygwin.com/ to install Cygwin,
including the ``g++-mingw32`` compiler and the ``MingW32`` libraries.
If you plan to track development of Gamera, you will probably also
want to install ``subversion``.

The important thing to note here is that we are using Cygwin's Mingw32
compiler to build for the standard (non-Cygwin) Python from
python.org.  After a clean install of Cygwin, typing 'python' will
start up Cygwin's version of Python, not the one from python.org.
Therefore, you will want to add the standard Python to your Cygwin
PATH using the command (assuming you installed Python in standard location)::

  export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Python25/:$PATH

Ensure you are using the correct Python by typing::

  which python

The result should be ``/cygdrive/c/Python25/python.exe``, not
``/usr/bin/python``.

Beware that the file ``/usr/bin/gcc`` installed by Cygwin actually
is *not* the compiler executable, but a symbolic link. Symbolic
links are not supported by MS Windows, but are a Cygwin-only
feature. This means that the Python Distutils system cannot execute
``/usr/bin/gcc`` and the build command will fail. To fix this,
replace the symbolic link with the actual compiler executable::

  mv /usr/bin/gcc-3 /usr/bin/gcc
  mv /usr/bin/g++-3 /usr/bin/g++

From here on, you can proceed as for the standalone Mingw32 toolchain,
i.e.::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
  dist/gamera-X.X.X-win32.exe


Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 2.3 and later are supported, though Python 2.4 or later is
  recommended.

  You will need to have the headers (but not the complete source) to
  build Gamera from source code.  Most Linux distributions include
  these as a separate package (eg. ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel``).

- wxPython 2.4.x or later (wxPython 2.8.x or later recommended for
  full functionality).

- ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later.

- libtiff 3.5.x or later

- libpng 1.2.x or later

If any of these prerequisites is installed in a non standard directory,
you can use the environment variables ``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` to
pass its locations to the build script, e.g.::

  CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
  LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
  export CFLAGS LDFLAGS


Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
terminal and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Installing without root priviledges
-----------------------------------

.. _without_root:

If you do not have root access to your machine, you can make a local
installation of Gamera.

A quick-and-easy way to do this is to use the ``virtual_python.py``
script available here__, and then follow the standard installation
instructions (without using sudo)::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

.. __: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python

Alternatively, you can set up a local installation by hand.

Make a local python module directory somewhere that you have write
priviledges (such as your home directory)::

  mkdir ~/python

From the Gamera build directory, install Gamera into that directory::

  python setup.py install --home=~/python

Set up an environment variables so Python can find stuff there (you
may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile file)::

  export PYTHONPATH=~/python/lib/python

Add the local Python scripts directory to your path::

  export PATH=~/python/bin:$PATH

Now you should be able to run the ``gamera_gui`` script from the
command line.

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui`` script, which should have installed to
``/usr/local/bin``.  This file can also be copied anywhere (such as
the Desktop) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of Gamera.

Mac OS-X
========

Earlier versions of Gamera ran on OS-X by using X11 as an emulation of
a standard Unix environment.  The current SVN version of Gamera now
uses Cocoa, and feels much more like a standard Macintosh
application.  Please follow the instructions for *either* X11 or Cocoa
install below.


Native (Cocoa) build
--------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

Gamera installs out of the box on Mac OS-X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard).
The only prerequisite is to install XCode, which is shipped with the
OS-X installation DVD, but is not installed by default.

It should be noted that OS-X 10.4 comes with the unstable branch 2.5 of
wxPython. So far we have not yet encountered any problems with this
version, but if you have any problems, please consider to install
wxPython 2.6 instead. This is *not* possible from the binary
installers from http://www.wxpython.org/, because there is none for
Python 2.3, and the other Python versions require a particular prerelease
of Xcode to build extensions, that is no longer available.
So if you decide to upgrade wxPython on OS-X 10.4, you must do it from
the source release of wxPython 2.6.

Standard Build and Install
``````````````````````````

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.

To build Gamera, open a X11 terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin priviledges)::

  sudo python setup.py install

The scripts can be installed by::

  sudo python setup.py install_scripts -d /usr/bin

.. note:: The ``-d /usr/bin/`` installs the scripts in a reasonable
  place on the PATH.  If you do not specify it, the scripts are by
  default installed to
  ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin``.
  So you can also simply add this directory to your PATH environment
  variable and forget about the *install_scripts* step.

Installing without root priviledges
```````````````````````````````````

The instructions for `installing without root (administrator)
priviledges`__ can also be used on Mac OS-X.

__ without_root_

Running
```````

Start the Terminal application and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of
  Gamera.


X11 build
---------

Please note that this build is no longer maintained by the Gamera developers.
So use it only when the Cocoa is not possible for some reason (e.g. on a 
legacy OS-X 10.3 system).

Prerequisites
`````````````

- Mac OS-X 10.4 (Tiger) or presumably later

- Python 2.3 (including the version included).

- wxPython-GTK 2.4.x or later

  Since there is no official build of the Gtk+/X11 version for Mac
  OS-X, I have made one available in the Gamera SourceForge Files
  section.

- XCode.  The version of XCode that shipped on the Tiger installation
  DVD will not work if you plan to use a newer version of Python
  downloaded from python.org.  XCode 2.4.1, may be downloaded from
  http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode .

- X11.  This is available on the Tiger installation DVD.  You should
  also use Software Update to update X11 to the latest version.

Standard Build and Install
``````````````````````````

Download and install the unoffical wxPython-Gtk-X11 distribution from
the Gamera Files section on SourceForge.

  Alternatively, you can install fink and then build the package
  wxPython-Py23, which is currently in the unstable branch, (and its
  dependencies) from source.  You will then need to use the fink
  version of Python (not the one that Apple provides) to carry out the
  instructions below.

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.

To build Gamera, open a X11 terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin priviledges)::

  sudo python setup.py install

The scripts can be installed by::

  sudo python setup.py install_scripts -d /usr/bin

.. note:: The ``-d /usr/bin/`` installs the scripts in a reasonable
  place on the PATH.  If you do not specify it, the scripts are by
  default installed to
  ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin``.

Installing without root priviledges
```````````````````````````````````

The instructions for `installing without root (administrator)
priviledges`__ can also be used on Mac OS-X.

__ without_root_

Running
```````

Start an X11 terminal and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of
  Gamera.
