==============================
Building and installing Gamera
==============================

Gamera requires that you install the following software FIRST:

**Python**
	For Linux (and other Unices):
	    Python 2.2 and 2.3 are supported.

	    You will need to have the headers (but not the complete
   	    source) to build Gamera from source code.  Some Linux
	    distributions, such as SuSE and RedHat, include these as a
 	    separate package (eg. ``python-dev``).

	For Microsoft Windows:
	    Only Python 2.3 is supported, since it has a much better
	    installer.
	
	For Mac OS-X:
	    Only Python 2.3 is supported, and only on OS-X 10.3 with
	    X11 installed.

	Make sure you have the latest
	service release, since those
	usually	contain important bug and security fixes.

**wxPython**
	You must use version 2.4.x or greater.  2.3.x is no longer
	supported.

	wxPython tends to change dramatically with even minor version
	increments (argh!).  I'm currently using 2.4.2.4, but I don't
	have the resources to support all different minor versions, so
	if you're having GUI-related problems, I would recommend
	downloading that **exact** version before submitting a bug report.


Microsoft Windows
=================

Installing using the Windows installer
--------------------------------------

If you downloaded the Windows installer, simply run it to
install Gamera.

.. note:: Windows is not our primary development environment, and the
   Windows installer tends to lag a version or two behind and may not
   be as thoroughly tested.  Anyone want to become the official
   Windows builder/tester?

Installing from source
----------------------

Currently, Gamera can be built using the Cygwin/MingW32/GNU toolset or 
Microsoft Visual Studio 6 or 7.

Cygwin/Mingw32
``````````````

Use the installer from http://www.cygwin.com/ to install Cygwin,
including the ``g++`` compiler and the ``MingW32`` libraries.
Compiling Gamera against the Cygwin DLL is theoretically possible, but
not supported.  However, you can compile Gamera using ``MingW32``, which
means there will be no non-standard Windows runtime dependancies.

Python
''''''

You have two options here

Use the Cygwin version Python that is distributed with Cygwin:
   This is the easiest approach, since it behaves most like a Unix
   system.  Skip to the next section for further instructions.

Use the MSVC-built Python from python.org:
   The advantage of this approach is that you can build an installer
   that will work with the "canonical" distribution of Python.
   However, you'll have to do a few preparation steps first.

   Go to the Python/libs directory::
	
	cd [PATH_TO_PYTHON]/libs

   Find your ``pythonXX.dll`` file, where ``XX`` is the version of
   Python you have installed.  This is normally in
   ``C:\WINDOWS\system32\`` or ``C:\winnt\system32\``.

   Make a ``.def`` file from your ``pythonXX.dll``.  (You will need to
   install ``pexports.exe`` from the Cygwin installer)::

  	pexports 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\pythonXX.dll' > pythonXX.def

   Then create a static library (``libpythonXX.a``)::

	dlltool --dllname pythonXX.dll --def
                pythonXX.def --output-lib libpythonXX.a
	
   Now you should be ready to continue below.

Standard Build and Install
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
Cygwin command prompt and type::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32

If you receive the following error (only exhibited under Python 2.3),
distutils is having trouble traversing the Cygwin-based symlink from
``/bin/cc.exe`` to ``/bin/gcc.exe``.  The hacky solution to this
(until this bugfix in distutils is fixed) is to delete the symlink and
make a real copy (at the expense of a little disk space)::

  rm /bin/cc.exe
  cp /bin/gcc.exe /bin/cc.exe

If you just want to install Gamera without the ability to uninstall::

  python setup.py install

If you'd like a real Windows installer, including uninstallation
support::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
  dist/gamera-X.X.X-win32.exe

Microsoft Visual Studio
```````````````````````

Compiling Gamera with MS Visual Studio should be considered
preliminary and non-preferred.  Particularly in light of all of the
backwardly-incompatible things in Visual Studio .NET, it is a bit of a
pain.

First and foremost, you will need to ensure that Python was compiled
with the same version of Visual Studio as you use to compile Gamera.
At the time of this writing, the "official" distribution of Python was
compiled with Visual Studio 6.  If the compilers so not match, you may
need to recompile Python, which is a daunting task beyond the scope of
this document.

Standard Build and Install
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
Microsoft Visual Studio Command Prompt (this should have been added to
the Start Menu when you installed Visual Studio).  Change to the
directory where the Gamera source is installed and type::

  python setup.py build

If you just want to install Gamera without the ability to uninstall::

  python setup.py install

If you'd like a real Windows installer, including uninstallation
support::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
  dist/gamera-X.X.X-win32.exe


Running
```````

If you chose to build the installer, double-click on the Gamera icon
on your desktop to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the Gamera compiled shared
  object files.

This file can be copied anywhere (such as the Desktop or the
Start Menu) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Install binary packages for Python and wxPython (see correct versions
at top of this document.)

In addition, your Linux installation should also have:

- libtiff 3.5.x
- libpng 2.2.x

Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
terminal and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui.py`` script, which should have installed to
``/usr/local/bin``.  
This file can also be copied anywhere (such as the Desktop) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the Gamera compiled shared
  object files.

Mac OS-X
========

OS-X support can be considered working but preliminary at this point.
Gamera will only run on Panther (10.3).  We do not plan to support
earlier versions.  You will need to install the GNU development tools
(gcc, g++, ld etc.), X11, and Python 2.3.

Prerequisites
-------------

wxPython comes in two flavors for OS-X: a native Carbon-based one that
follows the look-and-feel of OS-X, and a version built on top of
Gtk+/X11.  The native Carbon version is currently too incomplete to be
usable for Gamera.  Since there is no official build of the
Gtk+/X11 version, I have made one available in the Gamera
SourceForge Files section.

Standard Build and Install
----------------------------

Download and install the unoffical wxPython-Gtk-X11 distribution from
the Gamera Files section on SourceForge.

  Alternatively, you can install fink and then build the package
  wxPython-Py23, which is currently in the unstable branch, (and its
  dependencies) from source.  You will then need to use the fink
  version of Python (not the one that Apple provides) to carry out the
  instructions below.

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  

To build Gamera, open a X11 terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin priviledges)::
 
  sudo python setup.py install

The scripts can be installed by::

  sudo python setup.py install_scripts -d /usr/bin

.. note:: The ``-d /usr/bin/`` installs the scripts in a reasonable
  place on the PATH.  If you do not specify it, the scripts are by
  default installed to ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin``.

Running
-------

Start an X11 terminal and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.  

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the Gamera compiled shared
  object files.
