=====================
Gamera classifier API
=====================

Introduction
------------

For manual training of a classifier, you will generally want to use
the `interactive classifier GUI`__.  This document describes the
programming API that is used by scripts that make use of a classifier.

.. __: gui.html#interactive-classifier-window

At present, Gamera supports segmentation-based image classification.
This means that the page image is first segmented into individual
connected components (or glyphs).  Each of these glyphs has a number
of features generated from it.  These features (collectively called a
"feature vector") are then used inside a classifier which, using a
database of training data, identifies the glyph.

Interactive vs. Noninteractive classifiers
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All classifiers in Gamera support the same core Classifier API (interface), so
they are interchangeable.  There is an important
distinction between two families of classifiers, however:

Interactive classifier
  An interactive classifier can have training examples added to it in
  real time, and the results used immediately to classify glyphs.
  Interactive classifiers are useful during the training process since
  the classifier can be "boot strapped" with a few examples and refined
  interactively. 

Noninteractive classifier
  Noninteractive classifiers take a complete database of
  training data and then create an optimised data structure for
  classification.  Because building that data structure can take a
  considerable amount of time, new training examples cannot be added
  on the fly.  In addition, noninteractive classifiers are
  serializable to binary classifier-specific file formats, which save
  and load much faster than the Gamera XML format.

Types of classifiers
''''''''''''''''''''

Within each of these families, different classifiers are available.
These "concrete" classifiers have additional methods specific to the
particular classifier type.  The currently implemented classifiers
are all *k* - nearest-neighbor, but we plan to add other classifiers
as needed.

 - kNNInteractive_
     Interactive *k* nearest neighbor classifier.

 - kNNNonInteractive_
     Noninteractive *k* nearest neighbor classifier.  The weights of
     the dimensions can be optimised using a genetic algorithm.

     For a user-friendly way to perform GA optimization, consider the Biollante_
     tool in the Gamera GUI.

Classifying images without a classifier
---------------------------------------

``id_name``
'''''''''''

When a glyph is classified, either by a manual classification or an
automatic classifier, its classification is stored in the member variable
``id_name``.  This variable is actually a list of possible
classifications, so that a classifier can return a number of different
possibilities with different confidences.  Each classification entry
is a tuple of the form (float *confidence*, string *name*).  The
"confidence" value is set to (1-*dist*/*max_dist*)^10, where 
*dist* is the distance to the closest prototype of this class, and
*max_dist* is the distance to the farthest prototype of the entire
training population. Thus the "confidence" is always between 0.0 and
1.0, where 1.0 only occurs for feature values that exactly match a training
sample.

For example, if a symbol is most likely a lower-case *b*, but might
also be a lower-case *d*, its ``id_name`` variable might be:

.. code:: Python
  
  [(0.8, 'lower.b'), (0.2, 'lower.d')]

``classification_state``
''''''''''''''''''''''''

How a glyph was classified is managed by the ``classification_state``
member variable.  It can be one of the following values:

  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | Color    | Constant     | Description                                         |
  +==========+==============+=====================================================+
  | |UColor| | UNCLASSIFIED | The connected component is completely unclassified. |
  | (white)  |              |                                                     |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |AColor| | AUTOMATIC    | The connected component was classified by the       | 
  | (red)    |              | automatic classifier using training data.           |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |HColor| | HEURISTIC    | The connected component was classified by some      |
  | (yellow) |              | heuristic (non-exemplar-based) process.             |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
  | |MColor| | MANUAL       | The connected component was classified by a human.  |
  | (green)  |              |                                                     |
  +----------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Methods
'''''''

Images have a number of methods for managing their classification
state.  Use of these methods is highly recommended over changing the
``id_name`` variable directly.  These methods are documented in the
`classification section of the plugin documentation`__.

.. __: plugins.html#classification

The classifier interface
------------------------

This section describes each method of the classifier interface.
They are divided into two categories:

Core
  Methods available to all classifiers

Interactive
  Methods available only to interactive classifiers

Core
''''

The following methods are available to all classifiers.

Initialization
``````````````

This describes constructing a classifier.

.. docstring:: gamera.classify NonInteractiveClassifier __init__ 

Classification
``````````````

The following methods deal with classifying glyphs on a individual level.

.. docstring:: gamera.classify NonInteractiveClassifier classify_glyph_automatic classify_list_automatic classify_and_update_list_automatic guess_glyph_automatic

Grouping
````````

Often, characters do not cleanly correspond to connected components.
For instance, broken or degraded printing may disconnect parts of a
character, or characters, such as *i* may always be made up of two
connected components.  The grouping algorithm is designed to deal with
those cases.  It attempts to group connected components with others
nearby in order to create groupings that are more like glyphs in the
database.  Needless to say, this approach is much slower than the
"one-connected-component-at-a-time" approach, but can produce
considerably better results on certain images.

To train for grouping, images corresponding to the entire character
must exist in the database.  For instance, in the Gamera GUI, one
would select both the dot and stem of a lower-case *i* and train it as
``_group.lower.i``.  This will join the two connected components into
a single image and then add it to the database.

The algorithm is described in more detail in our paper on `correcting
broken characters`__ (PDF).

Saving and loading
``````````````````

These functions deal with saving and loading the training data of the
classifier to/from the `Gamera XML format`__.

   (neither saved or loaded).

*k* Nearest Neighbor classifier
-------------------------------

The *k* Nearest Neighbor classifier is a concrete example of the
classifier API.  It adds some methods of its own.

``kNNNonInteractive`` has a number of advantages over
``kNNInteractive``:

- Each feature is normalized independently in the range (0, 1).  This
  reduces the bias toward features that generate large values, such as
  ``area``.  This normalization may change the classifications that
  the classifier makes, however.

- The weights of the features can be optimized using a genetic
  algorithm.  (See start_optimizing_).

  For a user-friendly way to perform GA optimization, consider the Biollante_
  tool in the Gamera GUI.

.. _Biollante: gui.html#classifier-optimization-biollante

- The training data can be serialized to a classifier-specific binary file
  format.  This format saves and loads much faster than the Gamera XML
  file format.

.. note:: 
   It is good practice to retain the XML
   file, since it is portable across platforms and to future versions of
   Gamera.  The binary format is not guaranteed to be portable.

Feature management
''''''''''''''''''

The classifier automatically manages the generation of feature vectors
from glyphs.  When a feature vector is needed because it is being
automatically classified or added to the training set, it is
automatically generated on-the-fly.

By default, the feature generation method in kNN is quite simple.  The
user of the classifier provides a list of feature function names
(either in the constructor or through the ``change_feature_set``
method), and for each glyph, the results of each feature function in
the set are appended together to produce a feature vector.

This basic feature generation method can be overridden and replaced
with something more appropriate to other problem domains.  See the
`overriding kNN's feature generation`__ appendix for more information.

.. __: overriding_knn_features.html

Methods on all ``kNN`` classes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

kNN Initialization
``````````````````

.. docstring:: gamera.knn kNNNonInteractive __init__

Settings
````````

Settings are various parameters that control the behavior of the
classifier. While some are only accessible through the methods given below,
the following settings are plain properties of all kNN classifier classes:

*num_k*
    the number *k* of neighbors to be considered

*distance_type*
    the distance measure for neighborhood. Can be one of
    ``CITY_BLOCK`` (default), ``EUCLIDEAN`` or ``FAST_EUCLIDEAN``


.. docstring:: gamera.knn kNNInteractive change_feature_set

.. docstring:: gamera.knn _kNNBase save_settings load_settings

Serialization
`````````````
.. docstring:: gamera.knn _kNNBase serialize unserialize

Evaluation

.. docstring:: gamera.knn _kNNBase evaluate distance_from_images distance_between_images distance_matrix unique_distances

``kNNInteractive``
''''''''''''''''''

.. docstring:: gamera.knn kNNInteractive __init__

.. docstring:: gamera.knn kNNInteractive noninteractive_copy

``kNNNonInteractive``
'''''''''''''''''''''

Optimization
````````````

These methods pertain to optimizing the feature weights of the classifier
using a genetic algorithm (GA). For information about genetic algorithms,
see [Holland1975]_. The GA implementation in Gamera is based on [GAlib]_.

Improving kNN Classifiers using Editing
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Gamera provides a way to improve kNN classifiers by modifying the underlying
set of glyphs (training-set). This class of algorithms either removes bad or 
redundant glyphs or even creates new *optimal* glyphs from the training-set.

Besides the graphical user interface in the `Classifier Display`__, it is also
possible to invoke the algorithms from your script.

.. __: gui.html#classifier-menu

Each editing algorithm is a function, that takes at least one parameter, a 
*kNNInteractive* classifier - and returns a new edited *kNNInteractive* 
classifier. Any additional parameters depend on the effective algorithm, but are
optional by convention.

Currently the following editing algorithms are included with Gamera:

.. docstring:: gamera.knn_editing edit_mnn
 
.. docstring:: gamera.knn_editing edit_cnn 

.. docstring:: gamera.knn_editing edit_mnn_cnn


Usage Example
`````````````

The algorithms are located in the *gamera.knn_editing* package. So a typical 
usage example employing Wilson's *Modified Nearest Neighbour* (edit_mnn) would 
look like this:

.. code:: Python

  from gamera.core import init_gamera
  init_gamera()
  
  from gamera.knn import kNNInteractive
  classifier = kNNInteractive()
  classifier.from_xml_filename("training-set.xml")
  
  from gamera.knn_editing import edit_mnn
  editedClassifier = edit_mnn(classifier)

To display the glyphs removed by the editing algorithm, you can use
the following code in the Gamera GUI:

.. code:: Python

   set1 = classifier.get_glyphs()
   set2 = editedClassifier.get_glyphs()
   imagelist = list(set1.difference(set2))
   display_multi(imagelist)


Integrating your own editing algorithm
``````````````````````````````````````

If you have written your own editing algorithm and want to make it available in
the Classifier GUI, refer to the documentation of the class 
**gamera.knn_editing.AlgoRegistry**.
