Building and installing Gamera
==============================

Gamera requires that you install the following software FIRST:

**Python**
	Gamera is known to run on Python 2.2 and 2.3, though 2.3 is
	not as thouroughly tested.  Make sure you have the latest
	service release of either of these versions.

	You will need to have the headers (but not the complete
	source) to build Gamera from source code.  All standard Python
	installations include these.

**wxPython**
	You must use version 2.4.x or greater.  2.3.x is no longer
	supported.

	wxPython tends to change dramatically with even minor version
	increments (argh!).  I'm currently using 2.4.2.4, but I don't
	have the resources to support all different minor versions, so
	if you're having GUI-related problems, I would recommend
	downloading that **exact** version before submitting a bug report.


Microsoft Windows
=================

Installing using the Windows installer
--------------------------------------

If you got the Windows installer, simply run it to
install Gamera.  Unfortunately, we're having trouble getting the
startup script (``gamera_gui.py``) to be installed by the installer, so 
you'll have to install that yourself.  Do a ``Search...``
for it after installing Gamera.  You can place it anywhere,
(such as the Desktop) and simply double-click it to start Gamera.

.. note:: Windows is not our primary development environment, and the
   Windows installer tends to lag a version or two behind and may not
   be as thoroughly tested.  Anyone want to become the official
   Windows builder/tester?

Installing from source
----------------------

Currently, Gamera can be built using the Cygwin/MingW32/GNU toolset.
Support for Microsoft Visual Studio is coming.

Cygwin/Mingw32
``````````````

Use the installer from http://www.cygwin.com/ to install Cygwin,
including a g++ and the MingW32 libraries.

Standard Build and Install
``````````````````````````

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
Cygwin command prompt and type::

  python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
  python setup.py install

Running
```````

Run the ``gamera_gui.py`` script located at the root of the source
tree::

  python gamera_gui.py

This file can be copied anywhere (such as the Desktop or the
Start Menu) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Install binary packages for Python and wxPython (see correct versions
at top of this document.)  libtiff 3.5.x will also need to be installed.

Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
Cygwin command prompt and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui.py`` script located at the root of the source
tree.  This file can be copied anywhere (such as the Desktop)
and double-clicked to run Gamera.


Mac OS-X
========

OS-X support can be considered working but preliminary at this point.
Gamera will only run on Panther (10.3).  We do not plan to support
earlier versions.  You will need to install the GNU development tools, X11,
and Python 2.3.

Prerequisites
-------------

wxPython comes in two flavors for OS-X: a native Carbon-based one that
follows the look-and-feel of OS-X, and a version built on top of
Gtk+/X11.  The native Carbon version is currently too incomplete to be
usable for Gamera.  Unfortunately, there are no installer packages
available for the Gtk+/X11 version on the wxPython website.  You have
two options:

1. Install fink and then build the package wxPython-Py23, which is
   currently in the unstable branch, (and its dependencies) from
   source.  You will then need to use the fink version of Python (not
   the one that Apple provides) to carry out the instructions below.

2. Use the unofficial wxPython/Gtk/X11 installer on the Gamera website (coming
   soon).  It is not clear whether this installer will work for all
   Panther installations.

Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  

Make sure you're using the "right" Python.  If you compiled wxPython
yourself, you will need to use the fink Python.  If you used the
unofficial wxPython/Gtk/X11 installer, you need to use the Python
included with OS-X 10.3.  In a terminal, type::

  whereis python

If this is under ``/sw/fink``, your default Python is the fink
Python.  If not, you're default Python is probably the OS-X default.

To build Gamera, open a X11 terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin priviledges)::
 
  sudo python setup.py install

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui.py`` script located at the root of the source
tree.  This file can be copied anywhere (such as the Desktop)
and double-clicked to run Gamera.
