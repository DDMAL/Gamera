BUILDING GAMERA
========================================
2002 Michael Droettboom


Gamera requires that you install the following software FIRST:

- Python 2.2.1 (or greater) (www.python.org)
- wxPython 2.3.3.1 (or greater) (www.wxpython.org)

========================================

INSTALLING FROM A PRECOMPILED BINARY

If you got the precompiled binary on Windows, simply run it to
install Gamera.  Unfortunately, we're having trouble getting the
startup script (gamera_gui.py) to be installed by the installer, so 
you'll have to install that yourself.  You can place it anywhere,
(such as the Desktop) and simply double-click it to start Gamera.
(We hope to have this problem fixed shortly.)

========================================

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE

Standard Build and Install

As described in section, building and installing a module
distribution using the Distutils is usually one simple command:

python setup.py install

On Unix, you'd run this command from a shell prompt; on Windows, you
have to open a command prompt window (``DOS box'') and do it there.

========================================

Platform variations

UNIX

You should always run the setup command from the distribution root
directory, i.e. the top-level subdirectory that the module source
distribution unpacks into. For example, if you've just downloaded a
module source distribution gamera-2.0.tar.gz onto a Unix system, the
normal thing to do is:

tar zvxf gamera-2.0.tar.gz
cd gamera-2.0
python setup.py install

WINDOWS

On Windows, you'd probably download gamera-2.0.zip. If you downloaded the
archive file to C:\Temp, then it would unpack into C:\Temp\gamera-2.0;
you can use either a GUI archive manipulator (such as WinZip) or a
command-line tool (such as unzip or pkunzip) to unpack the
archive. Then, open a command prompt window (``DOS box''), and run:

cd c:\Temp\gamera-2.0 python setup.py install
