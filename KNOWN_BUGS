CVS IS A KNOWN BUG!!!

LINUX ISSUES
------------

Q: I start up the Gamera GUI, but everything is blank.

A: This is most likely due to some recent Linux distributions
(i.e. RedHat 8) setting the default locales to use UTF-8 encoding,
which isn't really working in wxPython 2.3.3.  Hopefully this error
will be corrected when wxWindows fully supports GTK+-2.0 and all of
its wonderful Unicode support.  Until then, you can get around it by
stripping off the UTF-8 on your LANG environment variable, such as:

> export LANG=en_US

Note: this problem is also fixed by upgrading to wxPython 2.3.4.2
(or presumably higher).
