The following issues in Gamera are known.
Fixes for some of them are currently under consideration.

 - Config options should be somewhere documented.

 - GAlib is a copy of an old version, which generates
   a number of compiler warnings. This should be updated

 - pixel values in Cc's can only be changed over the iterators,
   but not with set()
