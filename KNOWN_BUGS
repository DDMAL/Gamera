The following issues in Gamera are known.
Fixes for some of them are currently under consideration.

 - Plugin projection_cutting does not work as expected
   and removes pixels from the image when 'noise' is non zero.

 - init_gamera() prints a lot of stuff to stdout.
   This should be suppressable by a config option.

 - Config options should be somewhere documented.
