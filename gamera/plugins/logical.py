Usage examples:

Using logical functions in different ways will generally involve creating
temporary subimages for regions of interest.  Subimages are very lightweight
objects that keep track of a bounding box and refer to the underlying data,
therefore creating/destroying a number of these on the fly should not have
a significant impact on performance.

Padding an image.

.. code:: Python

  def pad_image(image, padding):
    new_image = Image(0, 0, image.nrows + padding * 2, image.ncols + padding * 2,
                      ONEBIT, DENSE)
    new_image.subimage(padding, padding, image.nrows, image.ncols).or_image(image, True)
    return new_image

Stamping an image over a larger image.  Use subimage to change the
destination of the stamp.

.. code:: Python

  # stamp: a small stamp image
  # paper: a larger destination image
  for x in range(0, 100, 10):
    paper.subimage(0, x, stamp.nrows, stamp.ncols).or_image(stamp, True)

Putting part of a source image on the upper-left corner of a
destination image.

.. code:: Python

  # src: a source image
  # dest: a destination image
  dest.or_image(src.subimage(50, 50, 25, 25), True)

Removing a connected component from its original image.

.. code:: Python

  # src: the original image
  # cc: a cc on that image
  src.clip_image(cc).xor_image(cc, True)"""
