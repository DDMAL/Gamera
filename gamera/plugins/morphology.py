class dilate_with_structure(PluginFunction):
    """
    Performs a binary morphological dilation with the given structuring
    element.

    Note that it is necessary to specify which point in the
    structuring element shall be treated as origin. This allows for
    arbitrary structuring elements. Examples:

    .. code:: Python

      # same as image.dilate()
      structure = Image(Point(0,0), Point(2,2), ONEBIT)
      structure.fill(1)
      image = image.dilate_with_structure(structure, Point(1,1))

      # same as image.erode_dilate(3,0,0)
      structure = Image(Point(0,0), Point(6,6), ONEBIT)
      structure.fill(1)
      image = image.dilate_with_structure(structure, Point(3,3))

    The implementation is straightforward and can be slow for large
    structuring elements. If you know that your structuring element is
    connected and its origin is black, you can set *only_border* to
    ``True``, because in this case only the border pixels in the image
    need to be considered which can speed up the dilation for some
    images (though not for all).

    References:

      A proof that only the contour pixels need to be dilated for
      connected structuring elements containing their origin is given
      by Luc Vincent in *Morphological Transformations of Binary
      Images with Arbitrary Structuring Elements*, Signal Processing,
      Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 3-23, January 1991 (see theorem 2.13)
