    a way that it does not merge non touching connected components.

    black pixels and the center is not filled when this would connect
    disjoint pixels on the border. A detailed description of the
    algorithm can be found in

    pixels are of the same value. It should be noted that in this case,
    the modified version does *not* take care
    of connectivity. In other words, it can result in joining previously
    disconnected connected components, similar to a morphological closing
    operation, while at the same time small black speckles are removed.
