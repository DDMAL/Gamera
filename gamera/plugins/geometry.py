class voronoi_from_labeled_image(PluginFunction):
  u"""
  Computes the area Voronoi tesselation from an image containing labeled
  Cc's. In the returned onebit image, every pixel is labeled with the
  label value of the closest Cc in the input image.

  To prepare the input image, you can use cc_analysis__. When the Cc's
  only consist of single points, the area Voronoi tesselation is identical
  to the ordinary Voronoi tesselation.

  .. __: segmentation.html#cc-analysis

  The implementation applies a watershed algorithm to the distance transform
  of the input image, a method known as *seeded region growing* (U. K\u00f6the:
  *Primary Image Segmentation.* Proceedings 17th DAGM-Symposium, Springer,
  1995).

class voronoi_from_points(PluginFunction):
  """
  Computes the Voronoi tesselation from a list of points and point labels.

  The result is directly written to the input image. Each white pixel is
  labeled with the label value of the closest point. Non white pixel in the
  input image are not overwritten.

  The arguments *points* and *labels* specify the points and labels, such
  that ``labels[i]`` is the label of ``points[i]``. Note that the labels
  need not necessarily all be different, which can be useful as an 
  approximation of an area Voronoi tesselation.

  The algorithm is very simple: it stores the points in a `kd-tree`_ and
  then looks up the closest point for each image pixel. This has a runtime
  of *O(N log(n))*, where *N* is the number of image pixels and *n* is the
  number of points. For not too many points, this should be faster than the
  morphological region growing approach of `voronoi_from_labeled_image`_.

class labeled_region_neighbors(PluginFunction):
  """
  For an image containing labeled regions, a list of all label pairs belonging
  to touching regions is returned. When *eight_connectivity* is ``True``
  (default), 8-connectivity is used for neighborship, otherwise
  4-connectivity is used.

  This can be useful for building a Delaunay graph from a Voronoi tesselation
  as in the following example:

  .. code:: Python

    #
    # build Delaunay graph of neighboring (i.e. adjacent) Cc's
    #

    # create map label->Cc for faster lookup later
    ccs = image.cc_analysis()

    # compute area Voronoi tesselation and neighborship list
    voronoi = image.voronoi_from_labeled_image()
    labelpairs = voronoi.labeled_region_neighbors()

    # build map of all neighbors for each label for fast lookup
    neighbors = {}

       neighbors[label] = []
    for n in labelpairs:
       neighbors[n[0]].append(n[1])
       neighbors[n[1]].append(n[0])

    # now, all neighbors to a given cc can be looked up with
    neighbors_of_cc = [label_to_cc[label] for label in neighbors[cc.label]]
