    Returns an RGB Image where each segment is colored with one of the colors

    This function can be used to verify that the pagesegmentation 
    e.g. ``cc_analysis`` is working correctly for your image.

    The graph coloring algorithm is based on the "6-COLOR" alorithm for
    planar graphs, as described in:

        D. Matula, Y. Shiloach, R. Tarjan:
        `Two linear-time algorithms for five-coloring a planar graph.`__

        Stanford, Calif., 1980

.. __: ftp://db.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/80/830/CS-TR-80-830.pdf

    We have modified the algorithm in such way that the color distribution is
    balanced, i.e. that each color is assigned approximately to the same
    number of nodes (also known as \"equitable coloring\").

    *ccs*:
        ImageList which contains ccs to be colored. Must be views on
        the image an which this method is called.

    *colors*:
        list of colors (instances of RGBPixel) which will be used for coloring

    *method*:
        Controls the calculation of the neighborhood graph:

            0 = from the CC center points
            (fastest, but can be inaccurate for large CC's)

            1 = from a 20 percent sample of the contour points
            (reasonable compromise between speed and accuracy)

            2 = from the exact area Voronoi diagram
            (can be slow on large images)
