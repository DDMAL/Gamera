Thus a rotate followed by a projection_cols would be conceptually the

This function is overloaded to work both with a single angle and a list
of angles as input. In the first case a single projection vector is
returned, in the second a list of projections vectors. This is explained
in the following example:

.. code:: Python

   # called twice with a single angle as input

moved outside the original image size are simply clipped, which restricts
this method to small angles.

projections (see Ha, Bunke: 'Image Processing Methods for Document Image
Analysis' in 'Handbook of Character Recognition and Document Image Analysis'
edited by Bunke and Wang, World Scientific 1997).

This method works for a wide range of documents (text, music, forms), but
can become slow for large images. This particular implementation can be
accelerated by reducing the number of black pixels in the image, eg. by
scaling it down, only considering a fraction of the image or by removing
'uninteresting' pixels.

Arguments:

*minangle*, *maxangle* (optional):
  angle interval that is searched for the skew angle;
  default values are -2.5 and +2.5

*accuracy* (optional):
  error bound for the skew angle estimate;
  default value is zero

When *accuracy* is set to zero, a default value of *180\*0.5/(image.ncols\*pi)*
is used, which is only a heuristic formula for little changes in the projection
profile.

Return Values:

*rotation angle*:
  The rotation angle necessary to deskew the image.
  Can be used directly as input to rotate_

*accuracy*:
  Accuracy of the returned angle.
