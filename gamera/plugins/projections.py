Thus a rotateShear followed by a projection_cols would be conceptually the
same, albeit considerably slower.

This function is overloaded to work both with a single angle and a list
of angles as input. In the first case a single projection vector is
returned, in the second a list of projections vectors. This is explained
in the following example:

.. code:: Python

   # called twice with a single angle as input
   proj1 = img.projection_skewed_cols(0.5)
   proj1 = img.projection_skewed_cols(1.0)
   
   # the same result with one function call

   proj1 = projlist[0]
   proj2 = projlist[1]

Note that unlike rotateShear_ the image size is not extended. Image regions
moved outside the original image size are simply clipped, which restricts
this method to small angles.
