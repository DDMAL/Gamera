   """
   Permutes the given list (in place) one step.

   Returns ``True`` if there are more permutations to go.  Returns
   ``False`` if permutations are done.

   Example usage::

     >>>a = [1,2,3]
     >>>while listutilities.permute_list(a):
     ...    print a

class median(PluginFunction):
    """Compute the median from a list of values in linear time.

This implementation works both with builtin numeric types like *int* or
*float*, and with user defined types. For user defined type, you
must implement the "less than" operator (`__lt__`), as in the following
example:

.. code:: Python

   class P:
      x = 0; y = 0
      def __init__(self, x, y):
          self.x = x; self.y = y
      def __lt__(self, other):
          return (self.x < other.x)
      def __eq__(self, other):
          return (self.x == other.x)

   a = [P(0,0), P(1,1), P(2,0)]
   p = median(a)

When the parameter *inlist* is ``True``, the median is always a list entry,
even for lists of even size. Otherwise, the median is for an
even size list of *int* or *float* values the mean between the two middle
values. So if you need the median for a pivot element, set *inlist* to
``True``.

For user defined types, the returned median is always a list
entry, because arithmetic computations do not make sense in this case.

.. note::

   This is *not* the median image filter that replaces each pixel value
   with the median of its neighborhood. For this purpose, see the
   rank__ plugin.
