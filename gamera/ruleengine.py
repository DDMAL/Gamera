"""This module provides tools for applying graph-rewriting rules to a set of glyphs.

It would seem nice to invent a completely new language for this task
(for instance, a logic-programming language like Prolog might have been nice).

However, in this design, each rule is defined by a basic Python function. This integrates
much easier into the rest of the Python-based Gamera world, since any Python function can
be called at any time, and doesn't require the user to learn a new language.  The disadvantage
is that the pattern matching is single-tiered (no recursion) and the ordering and
application of the rules is left to the end programmer, since this approach makes it difficult
to do any global optimisation.  There may be ways around these limitations, but that will
require some thinking.

Rule functions take the basic form:

  def rule_function0(a="dot", b="letter*"):        # 1: function signature
    if (Fudge(a.lr_y) == b.lr_y and
        a.ul_x > b.lr_x and a.ul_x - b.lr_x < 20): # 2: expression
      a.classify_heuristic('punctuation.period')   # 3: operation
    return [], []                                  # 4: added, removed

1. The function signature itself is used to define which classes of glyphs should be applied
   to the function.  Each argument has a Python default value which is a string containing
   the symbol name or an "symbol name regular expression" that will match the glyph to be passed in.
   Yes, this is a complete bastardisation of what default arguments are meant for in Python, since
   these string values will never actually be passed in to the function.  However, I think this syntax
   is convenient and kind of cute.  (Another option might be to use some sort of special doc-string
   syntax, I suppose.)

   Rules are indexed by the first argument, so it is a good idea to use the least-frequently occuring
   symbol name (or the class the most clearly defines the structure) as the first argument.

   A "symbol name regular expression" is an instance of the special-purpose regular expression
   language for symbol names defined in id_name_matching.py.  This syntax is pretty limited compared to
   standard Python regular expression syntax, but is much more convenient for the task. (For example,
   'upper.*' would be 'upper\.[^.]*' as a standard Python regular expression, and nobody wants to
   write like that ;)
   
     Informal syntax definition:
       A|B                   # matches A or B
       A.B|C                 # matches A.B or A.C
       *                     # multiple-character wildcard
       ?                     # single character wildcard
       ()                    # grouping can be performed with parentheses
       [a-z]                 # matches any character a-z

     Example expressions:
       (upper.x)|(lower.y)   # match either upper.x or lower.y
       upper.*               # match anything in the 'upper' category
       upper.a|b|c           # matches upper.a, upper.b or upper.c
       upper.capital_?       # ? is a single character wildcard

2. The body of the function, in a literal sense, is left entirely up to the end-user programmer (it's
   just Python afterall.)  However, most rule functions will consist of some sort of test followed by
   some sort of change of the data.

   For performing tests that need to be somewhat "fuzzy", you may want to use Fudge objects.  Comparisons
   on Fudge objects have a built-in fuzzy zone around the core int, Point or Rect that make comparing
   things that just must be "close enough" easier.  (See fudge.py)

3. In the body, the rule function can modify the glyph attributes in any way it sees fit.

4. Optionally, the rule function can return a pair of lists.  The first list is of glyphs that have been
   created by the operation (for instance, if combining two glyphs into one union glyph.)  The second list
   is a list of glyphs that have been removed by the operation (for instance removing noise glyphs.)  (If
   your function returns None, the RuleEngine assumes you meant [], []). These results are appended together
   each time a set of rules is applied and returned to the caller. Optionally, the rule-performing mechanism
   can reapply rules to all the newly-created glyphs.

PERFORMING RULES:

Rules are grouped into RuleEngine classes, which then perform the actually searching and call the rule
functions.

# Initialise a new rule engine with a couple of rules
rule_engine = RuleEngine([rule_function0, rule_function1])
# Run the rules on the given list of glyphs
added, removed = rule_engine.perform_rules(glyphs)

TODO: There may be at some point some kind of Meta-RuleEngine for performing sets of rules in sequence
or parallel or whatever...
