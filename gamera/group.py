# GROUPING IN GENERAL:
#
# The grouping classifier interface allows glyphs to be grouped according to
# their physical relationships to each other.  The user classifies a set of
# glyphs as a "group", and other glyphs matching this general structure can
# later be located on the page.
#
# For documentation, there are two kinds of glyphs involved in this process:
#   part glyphs -- glyphs that should be grouped to form larger glyphs
#   union glyphs -- glyphs made up of part glyphs
