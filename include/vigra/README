Readme for VIGRA includion in Gamera
====================================

These header files are taken from VIGRA

	version 1.6.0

avaliable from 

http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/vigra/

Due to some shortcomings in VIGRA 1.6.0, the following
files are modified:

 - basicgeometry.hxx
     has been taken from the development branch of VIGRA
     to make the Gamera plugin "resize" work

 - stdconvolution.hxx
     a compiler warning about uninitialized variables is
     suppressed. This change is already included in the
     development branch of VIGRA

 - rational.hxx
     has been taken from the development branch of VIGRA
     to suppress a compiler warning about an "ambiguous else"

 - resizeimage.hxx
     has been taken from the development branch of VIGRA,
     even though this version still does not work correctly
     for an image resize without interpolation.
     Therefore never use resizeImageNoInterpolation(), but
     instead resampleImage()

 - inspectimage.hxx
     removed #pragma warning

 - affinegeometry.hxx
     corrected floating point errors in sinus and cosinus
     for exact rotations in rotateImage()
