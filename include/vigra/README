Readme for VIGRA includion in Gamera
====================================

These header files are taken from VIGRA

	version 1.5.0

avaliable from 

http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/vigra/

As the convolution in this version caused crashes in
Gamera (possibly due to changes/bugs in the implementation
of BORDER_TREATMENT_REFLECT in VIGRA), the file

	stdconvolution.hxx

is taken from VIGRA version 1.3.0.
