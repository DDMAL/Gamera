      NORMALIZE
      
      Normalize is used to compute normalization of the feature vectors in a database
      of known feature vectors and then to apply that normalization to feature
      vectors. It only works with doubles.

      Like the kNearestNeighbors class below, Normalize avoids knowing
      anything about the data structures used for storing the feature
      vectors. The add method is called for each feature vector,
      compute_normalization is called, and then feature vectors can
      be normalized by calling apply.
