  Many compilers (including gcc) don't have the standard header <limits> that
  (amoung other things) defines numeric_limits.  This header will include the
  standard header unless GAMERA_USE_BOOST_LIMITS macro is defined; if it is
  defined it will include the boost version that the boost developers created
  because they were so tired of compilers not including <limits>.
